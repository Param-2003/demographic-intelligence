# 🗺️ Demographic & Migration Intelligence for Policy Strategy

This project analyzes migration patterns in India based on census data. We focus on understanding where people are migrating **to**, their **previous residences**, and provide a **gender-based breakdown** of these migrations.

A data engineering + analytics project that processes large-scale population and migration data using PySpark and produces insights for political campaign targeting and policy design.

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:
- Last place of residence (`Last residence4`, `Last residence5`)
- Place of enumeration (where the person currently lives)
- Gender-wise migration counts:
  - `Total migrants-Persons`
  - `Total migrants-Males`
  - `Total migrants-Females`

- Migration trend analysis across regions
- Political vote segmentation
- Clustering voters by demographics
- Geo-visualizations of key patterns

## 🛠️ Stack

- PySpark
- GeoPandas + Plotly
- Dash (optional)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Electoral campaign optimization
- Urban policy forecasting
- Demographic-driven marketing

  # 🧭 Census Migration Analysis – India

## 🧹 Base DataFrame

We first create a **cleaned default DataFrame** by removing all "Total" level aggregate rows, retaining only records with specific information for analysis.

This base DataFrame becomes our foundation for performing different operations.

---

## 🔍 Key Operations

### 1. Migration Destination Analysis
We determine how many people migrated **to** each place (Rural or Urban) using the `Place of enumeration` column.

### 2. Gender Breakdown of Migrants
We analyze the **gender distribution** of migrants to identify male vs. female migration trends across regions.

### 3. Origin-Destination Relationship (Upcoming)
We'll map migration **from** different types of last residences **to** current places of enumeration.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries

- **PySpark** – for handling and transforming large-scale data
- **Pandas / Seaborn / Matplotlib** – for visualization and exploratory analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** – for development and experimentation

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Ensure PySpark is installed and your environment is set up.
2. Load the dataset and apply cleaning.
3. Run the operations using the modular functions (coming soon).
4. Visualize the results for insights.

## 📌 Status

✅ Base cleaning complete  
✅ Migration destination and gender split implemented  
🚧 Visualizations and regional filtering in progress  
🚧 State-to-state migration breakdown planned
